# Hey, I'm Rene 👋

Java/Spring Backend Engineer by day. AI, game and music tinkerer by night.

## Background
Self-taught — no CS degree, no bootcamp. Just 17 years of deep curiosity, pattern recognition, and an obsessive need to understand *why* things work the way they do.
Before I wrote code, I made music. Released under the name **Locuzzed** — drum and bass, BBC Radio 1 plays, European festival tours. That era taught me more about systems thinking, feedback loops, and shipping creative work than anything else.

Turns out mixing tracks and designing software aren't that different. Both require understanding how components interact under pressure.
